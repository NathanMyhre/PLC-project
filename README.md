Suffix Tree Creation in Haskell

Created by Nathan Myhre and Collin Lidstrom

Summary:
  For our final project, we chose to attempt creating an implementation of a Suffix Tree in Haskell. A Suffix Tree is defined as a compressed trie containing all suffixes of the given text as their keys and positions in the text as their values. Suffix Trees play an enormous role in String operations through their fast implementations.
